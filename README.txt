Kappy Studios is an imaginary company that makes free-to-play video games. This application is created to provide an interface to all of their games and gives the user the option of adding a game to their personalized library. The interface also allows user to perform several other tasks. Please note that all games are made up and that nothing is actually downloaded when a user adds a game to their library (although the game details appear in the library screen). In relation, the play button for games does nothing useful at the moment. The source code has been designed so that games can actually be downloaded and played but this wasn’t implemented as the interface itself is the focus of the application.

There are three steps to launch the program and the program only uses Java standard libraries. Please note that the following instructions are meant for the Mac OSX Terminal application.

Step 1 - Navigation:

- Go to the directory just outside the “kappystudios” directory.

  	javac kappystudios/Main.java


Step 3 - Execution:

—— STEPS END ——
